My app is a simple YuGiOh duel assister that keeps track of the players like points and can roll dice and flip coins depending
the users needs

Coin flip
The coin flip generates a random between 0 and 1 that deping on the result prints out heads or tails

Dice Roll
The dice roll generates a random number between 1 and 6 and depending on the result, prints out a dice image of 1-6

Calculator
Both playes start with 8000 life ponts and the users decide whether to add or subtract certain values based on the cards they play
Each button with a number represents the number being able to ve subtracted or added to the life point total
the equals button calculates the result so far when pressed
and the new game button resets the game back to 8000
